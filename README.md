# jmbus
This is a non-authorative fork of the Java M-Bus library jMBus / https://www.openmuc.org/m-bus/ by the openMUC project of the Department “Intelligent Energy Systems” at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, Germany. Please refer to their website!

jMBus is licensed under the GPLv3 and so are the changes.

This fork has only been started to introduce some additions to decode proprietary messages sent by Techem heat cost allocator devices (Heizkostenverteiler) via Wireless M-Bus. Those changes are submitted upstream, it is unsure, wheter they will be included or not.
