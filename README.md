This is a fork of the jMBus library from the [openMUC project](https://www.openmuc.org/). 
It is intended to be used within [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/), which is not possible with the original version as it is incompatible with the official `gnu.io`API of RXTX.

There is not yet any decision whether this fork will be further maintained, so please be careful when considering to use it. 
But if you are interested in it, please let us know!
